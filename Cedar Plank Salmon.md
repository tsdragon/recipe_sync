## Ingredients
- 1 side of salmon (preferably skin-on)
- Olive oil
- A bundle of fresh herbs (sage, rosemary, and thyme recommended)
- 1 lemon
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Cedar plank (soaked for 30 mins)
- Outdoor barbecue/grill

## Cook Time
- **Prep**: 40 mins
- **Cook**: 15 mins
- **Total**: 55 mins
- **Yield**: 4 servings

## Instructions
1. **Preparation**:
    - Soak the cedar plank in water for about 30 minutes.
    - Preheat your grill to high (around 550Â°F).
    - Descale the salmon if needed, leaving the skin on. This can be done by scraping the scales off with the back edge of a knife.
    - Cut the salmon into approximately 4-inch wide pieces.
    - Season the salmon pieces liberally with salt and pepper, then coat the top with olive oil.
    - Lay out the herbs in a layer on top of the cedar plank and cover them liberally with olive oil.
    - Cut the lemon in half. Slice one half into thin slices, one for each piece of salmon.

2. **Cooking**:
    - Place the salmon skin-side up (top side down) on the grill to get some nice color and grill marks, about 1-2 minutes.
    - Carefully remove the salmon from the grill and place it on the cedar plank over the herbs.
    - Ensure you have a safe place to put the cedar plank after grilling, such as an oven tray on a trivet, as the wood will be smoldering.
    - Place the cedar plank on the grill and close the lid. Allow the salmon to cook and smoke for 10-15 minutes. A good indicator of doneness is when you see white fat just starting to leak from the salmon.
    - When the desired doneness is reached, remove the plank from the grill and place it somewhere fire-safe like your oven tray.
    - Squeeze the juice from the remaining half of the lemon over the salmon and lay one lemon slice on top of each piece.
    - Allow the salmon to rest for about 4 minutes.

3. **Serving**:
    - Serve the smoked salmon with grilled asparagus or wild rice.

## Notes
- The term "side of salmon" refers to a whole side of the fish, typically with the skin on.
- The pieces of salmon are sometimes referred to as "cutlets" or "portions."
