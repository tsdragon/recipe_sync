## Ingredients
- 250g Flour
- 200g Cold salted butter
- 70g Ice water (more only if needed)

## Cook Time
- **Prep**: 15 minutes
- **Yield**: 520g

## Instructions
1. **Preparation**:
    - Cut the cold butter into small dice-sized cubes.
    - Add the flour and butter to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
    - Mix until the largest pieces of butter are about pea-sized. DO NOT OVER MIX. Squish any stubborn large pieces by had as opposed to running the mixer longer.
    - Add the ice water and mix until just combined into a shaggy dough. The dough should look dry and lumpy.

2. **Chilling**:
    - Gather the dough into as tight a ball as possible.
    - Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap.
    - Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.

3. **Use**:
    - Use the pâte brisée in any sweet or savoury pie recipe.
    - Roll out on a lightly floured surface when ready to use.

## Notes
- Do not over-mix; visible butter pieces help create flakiness.
- Add additional ice water only if the dough is too dry to come together.
- Dough can be chilled longer or frozen for later use.
