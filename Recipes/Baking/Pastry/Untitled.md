## Instructions
1. **Preparation**:
    - Step 1: Cut the cold butter into small dice-sized cubes.
    - Step 2: Add the flour and butter to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.
    - Step 3: Mix until the largest pieces of butter are about pea-sized.
    - Step 4: Add the ice water and mix until just combined into a shaggy dough. The dough should look dry and lumpy.

2. **Cooking**:
    - Step 1: Gather the dough into as tight a ball as possible.
    - Step 2: Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap.
    - Step 3: Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.

3. **Serving**:
    - Step 1: Use the pâte brisée as directed in your chosen recipe.
    - Step 2: Roll out on a lightly floured surface when ready to use.

## Notes
- Note 1: Do not over-mix; visible butter pieces help create flakiness.
- Note 2: Add additional ice water only if the dough is too dry to come together.
- Note 3: Dough can be chilled longer or frozen for later use.
