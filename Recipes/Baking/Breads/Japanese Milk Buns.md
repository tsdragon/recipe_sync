## Ingredients

### Tangzhong
- 45g water
- 45g whole milk
- 15g flour

### Dough
- 300g flour
- 15g milk powder
- 40g sugar
- 7g salt
- 1 tbsp yeast
- 115g whole milk
- 1 large egg
- 60g unsalted butter, melted

### Finishing
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted (for brushing)

## Cook Time
- **Prep**: 30 mins
- **Cook**: 15 to 20 mins
- **Total**: 3 hrs
- **Yield**: 9 buns

## Instructions
1. **Preparation**:
    - To make the tangzhong: Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.
    - Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.
    - Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool to lukewarm.
    - To make the dough: Weigh your flour. Combine the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients, then mix and knead — by mixer or bread machine — until a smooth, elastic dough forms; this could take almost 15 minutes in a stand mixer.
    - Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased bowl, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.
    - Gently deflate the dough and divide it into 9 equal pieces (about 75g each).
    - Shape each piece into a ball and place them in a lightly greased 9" square pan.
    - Cover the buns and allow them to rest/rise for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy.
    - Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 400°F.

2. **Cooking**:
    - Bake the buns for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown.
    - Remove the buns from the oven and immediately brush them with 4 tbsp of melted butter after placing them on a cooling rack.

3. **Serving**:
    - Store leftover buns, well wrapped, at cool room temperature for 5 to 7 days; freeze for longer storage.

## Notes
- **Tangzhong Technique**: With origins in Japan's yukone (or yudane), tangzhong is a yeast bread technique popularized across Asia by Taiwanese cookbook author Yvonne Chen. Tangzhong involves cooking some of a bread recipe’s flour in liquid prior to adding it to the remaining dough ingredients. Bringing the temperature of the flour and liquid to 65°C (149°F) pre-gelatinizes the flour’s starches, which makes them more able to retain liquid — thus enhancing the resulting bread's softness and shelf life.
- **Crust Variation**: Would you like a dark-gold, shiny crust on your buns? Make an egg wash by whisking together 1 large egg + 1 tablespoon cold water. Just before putting the buns into the oven, instead of brushing the tops with melted butter, brush them with some of the egg wash (you won't use all of it). Bake as directed.
