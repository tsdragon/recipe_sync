## Ingredients

### Tangzhong
- 45g water
- 45g whole milk
- 15g flour

### Dough
- 300g flour
- 15g milk powder
- 40g sugar
- 7g salt
- 1 tbsp yeast
- 115g whole milk
- 1 large egg
- 60g unsalted butter, melted

## Cook Time
- **Prep**: 30 mins
- **Cook**: 30 to 35 mins
- **Total**: 3 hrs 25 mins
- **Yield**: 1 sandwich loaf

## Instructions

### Preparation
1. **To make the tangzhong**: 
    - Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.
    - Place the saucepan over low heat and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.
    - Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool to lukewarm.

2. **To make the dough**:
    - Weigh your flour. Combine the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients, then mix and knead — by mixer or bread machine — until a smooth, elastic dough forms; this could take almost 15 minutes in a stand mixer.
    - Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased bowl, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.
    - Gently deflate the dough and divide it into 3 equal pieces; if you have a scale, each piece will weigh around 235g.
    - Flatten each piece of dough into a rectangle, then fold the short ends in towards one another like a letter. Flatten the folded pieces into rectangles again and, starting with a short end, roll them each into a 4" log.
    - Place the logs in a row of three — seam side down and side by side — in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan, preferably Pullman loaf.
    - Cover the loaf and allow it to rest/rise for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy.
    - Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.

### Cooking
1. **To bake the bread**: 
    - Optionally, brush the loaf with milk and then bake it for 30 minutes, until it's golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 190°F.
    - Remove the loaf from the oven and cool it in the pan until you can transfer it safely to a rack to cool completely.

### Serving
1. Store leftover bread, well wrapped, at cool room temperature for 5 to 7 days; freeze for longer storage.

## Notes
- **Tangzhong Technique**: With origins in Japan's yukone (or yudane), tangzhong is a yeast bread technique popularized across Asia by Taiwanese cookbook author Yvonne Chen. Tangzhong involves cooking some of a bread recipe’s flour in liquid prior to adding it to the remaining dough ingredients. Bringing the temperature of the flour and liquid to 65°C (149°F) pre-gelatinizes the flour’s starches, which makes them more able to retain liquid — thus enhancing the resulting bread's softness and shelf life.
- **Crust Variation**: Would you like a dark-gold, shiny crust on your loaf? Make an egg wash by whisking together 1 large egg + 1 tablespoon cold water. Just before putting the bread into the oven, instead of brushing the top crust with milk, brush it with some of the egg wash (you won't use all of it). Bake as directed.
