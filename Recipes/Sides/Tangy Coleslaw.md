## Ingredients
### Veggies

### Dressing
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp celery seeds

- **Total**: 20 mins (plus 2 hours resting time)
- **Yield**: 10-15 servings

## Instructions
1. **Preparation**:
    - Finely slice the green and red cabbage. A grater works very well for the carrots.

2. **Cooking**:
    - In a medium bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, celery seeds, and sugar. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
    - In a large serving bowl, toss together the sliced vegetables with the dressing until well coated.

## Notes
- The higher acidity of this coleslaw pairs best with fattier mains like brisket and pulled pork.
