## Ingredients
- 400g milk
- 1 egg
- 300g flour
- 70g sugar
- 6g salt
- 1g baking soda
- 15g baking powder
- 25g butter

## Cook Time
- **Prep**: 10 mins
- **Cook**: 20 mins
- **Total**: 30 mins
- **Yield**: 6-10 pancakes (depending on size)

## Instructions
1. **Preparation**:
    - In a microwave-safe bowl, mix together the butter, milk, salt, and sugar. Microwave until the butter is just melted, approximately 1 minute.
    - Add the egg to the melted mixture and beat well to combine.
    - In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda.
    - Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Do not over-mix.

2. **Cooking**:
    - Heat a pan over low-medium heat.
    - Better the pan liberally.
    - Pour the desired amount of batter onto the pan. For thinner pancakes, spread the batter out with a spatula.
    - Cook until the bottom is golden brown. Note: This batter is thick, so bubbles may not form on the top to indicate readiness; check for browning instead.
    - Flip and cook the other side until golden brown.

3. **Serving**:
    - Top with butter and serve with your preferred syrup or fruit topping.

## Notes
- These pancakes have a thick batter; if you prefer thinner pancakes, spread the batter with a spatula.
- Keeping pancakes warm in the oven is a great way to serve them all at once.
