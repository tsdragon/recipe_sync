## Cook Time
- **Prep**: 15–20 mins
- **Cook**: 30–40 mins
- **Total**: ~60 mins
- **Yield**: 2605 g (8 servings)

## Instructions
1. **Preparation**:
    - Dice the carrot, celery, onion, and cooked chicken into large, hearty chunks.
    - Dissolve the 30 ml Better Than Bouillon into 500 ml water to create a concentrated stock (or use any 1× concentrated stock).
    
2. **Cooking**:
    - In a large pot over medium to medium-high heat, melt the butter.    
    - Add the diced carrot and cook until it just begins to soften (about 5–10 minutes).
    - Add the celery and onion; cook until the onions begin to turn translucent.
    - Add the flour and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the raw flour smell is gone. Err on the side of cooking slightly longer.
    - Slowly pour in the stock while stirring constantly to avoid lumps.
    - Remove the pot from heat.
    - Stir in the milk and diced chicken.
    - Season with salt, pepper, and desired herbs and spices.
    - Stir in the frozen peas last to keep them from becoming mushy.
    
3. **Serving**:
    - For pie use: allow the filling to cool completely before assembling your pie.
    - For immediate serving: enjoy warm in a bowl as a hearty stew-like dish.
## Notes
- Using milk instead of cream keeps the recipe lighter but still creamy and rich. Trust me you do not need cream.
- Feel free to adjust vegetable ratios based on preference.
- Great for pot pies, hand pies, or as a standalone comfort meal.
