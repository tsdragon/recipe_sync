## Instructions

1. **Preparation**:
    
    - **Make Mixture A (7X flavoring)**:
        
        - Combine the lemon, lime, orange, tea tree, cassia cinnamon, nutmeg, and coriander essential oils with the fenchol in a container.
            
        - _(Optional but recommended)_ Allow the combined oils to age for 1–2 days.
            
        - Create the 7X solution by diluting **20 ml** of the combined oil mixture to **1 liter** with food-grade alcohol.
            
    - **Make Mixture B (water-based solution)**:
        
        - Add the Mixture B ingredients **one by one** into ~200 ml hot water, ensuring each ingredient fully dissolves before adding the next:  
            vinegar → caffeine → glycerin → phosphoric acid → wine tannins → vanilla/vanillin → caramel color.
            
        - Add water to dilute the mixture to a final volume of **1 liter**.
            
2. **Cooking (if applicable)**:
    
    - **Make the cola syrup base**:
        
        - Dissolve **104 g sugar** in just enough water (in a glass dish).
            
        - Add **10 ml Mixture B** and **1 ml Mixture A (7X)** to the sugar syrup.
            
        - Heat until it’s **almost boiling**, then cover to reduce loss of volatile flavors.
            
        - Cool completely.
            
3. **Serving (if applicable)**:
    
    - Once cooled, dilute the syrup with **cold carbonated water** to reach a final volume of **1 liter**.
        
    - For best flavor, rest the finished soda in the fridge for about **1 day**.
        

## Notes

- Wear gloves and measure accurately; some ingredients are mildly hazardous.
    
- Do not taste unmixed ingredients.
    
- Mixture A is prepared as a _7X alcohol solution_ by diluting **20 ml of the oil blend** up to **1 liter** with food-grade alcohol.

## Critical + Constructive Feedback

- **Major safety red flag: tea tree essential oil.** Tea tree oil is generally **not considered safe to ingest** and is associated with toxicity if swallowed. If this is intended to be a consumable drink, you’ll want to revisit that ingredient and confirm it’s truly meant to be included (and at that amount).
    
- **Phosphoric acid concentration is very high.** “85% phosphoric acid” is a hazardous concentration and needs careful handling and accurate dilution. Many food uses rely on _much more dilute_ acid solutions—this is a spot where a small measuring error can matter a lot.
    
- **Mixture A instructions are a bit ambiguous.** You combine the oils, then “dilute 20 ml to 1 liter” with alcohol—but it doesn’t explicitly say what happens to the _remaining_ oil blend (storage, stability, exact yield, etc.). Consider adding a clear line like: “Store the remaining oil blend sealed; only 20 ml is used per 1 L alcohol batch.”
    
- **Carbonation method isn’t defined.** “Cold carbonated water” is fine, but you may want to specify whether you’re using store-bought sparkling water, a SodaStream-style carbonator, or force carbonating—results vary a lot.
    
- **Quality control: measure by mass where possible.** Oils and small volumes (like 0.6–1.2 ml) are hard to measure accurately with kitchen tools. Using lab-style syringes/pipettes (and noting that in the recipe) would make outcomes more consistent.
    
- **Flavor rest is a good note—consider extending guidance.** “About a day” is helpful; you might add a range (e.g., 12–48 hours) _if you’ve tested it_, since these flavors can round out over time.
    

If you want, paste your intended “food-safe substitute” plan for the tea tree component (or where this formula came from), and I can help rewrite the ingredient list to be clearer and safer without inventing missing numbers.
