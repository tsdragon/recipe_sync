## Instructions

1. **Preparation**:
    - **Make 7X flavoring**:
        - Combine the lemon, lime, orange, tea tree, cassia cinnamon, nutmeg, and coriander essential oils with the fenchol in a container.
        - _(Optional but recommended)_ Allow the combined oils to age for 1–2 days.
        
    - **Make Mixture A**:
	    - Create Mixture A by diluting **20 ml** of the combined oil mixture to a volume of **1 litre** with food-grade alcohol.
	    
    - **Make Mixture B (water-based solution)**:
        - Add the Mixture B ingredients **one by one** into ~200 ml hot water, ensuring each ingredient fully dissolves before adding the next:  
            vinegar → caffeine → glycerin → phosphoric acid → wine tannins → vanilla/vanillin → caramel color.
        - Add water to dilute the mixture to a final volume of **1 litre**.
            
1. **Cooking:
    
    - **Make the cola syrup base**:
        - Dissolve **104 g sugar** in just enough water (in a glass dish).
        - Add **10 ml Mixture B** and **1 ml Mixture A (7X)** to the sugar syrup.
        - Heat until it’s **almost boiling**, cover to reduce loss of volatile flavors.
        - Cool completely.
            
2. **Serving:
    - Once cooled, dilute the syrup with **cold carbonated water** to reach a final volume of **1 litre**.
    - For best flavor, rest the finished soda in the fridge for about **1 day**.
